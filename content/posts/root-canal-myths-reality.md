Root canal treatment often gets a bad reputation, but modern techniques have made it a virtually painless and highly effective procedure. Let's separate fact from fiction about this tooth-saving treatment.

## Common Myths About Root Canals

### Myth 1: Root Canals Are Painful
**Reality**: Modern techniques and anesthesia make the procedure as comfortable as getting a filling.

### Myth 2: It's Better to Extract the Tooth
**Reality**: Saving your natural tooth through root canal treatment is almost always the better option.

### Myth 3: Root Canals Cause Illness
**Reality**: There is no scientific evidence linking root canal treatment to disease elsewhere in the body.
