Regular dental checkups are the cornerstone of maintaining excellent oral health. At Shree Dental Clinic, we recommend visiting your dentist every six months for a comprehensive examination and professional cleaning.

## Why Regular Checkups Matter

### 1. Early Detection
Regular checkups allow us to detect potential issues like cavities, gum disease, and oral cancer in their earliest stages. Early detection often means simpler, less expensive treatments and better outcomes.

### 2. Professional Cleaning
Even with excellent home care, plaque and tartar can build up in hard-to-reach areas. Our professional cleaning removes these deposits, helping prevent tooth decay and gum disease.

### 3. Preventive Care
During your checkup, we provide:
- Professional fluoride treatments
- Dental sealants when needed
- Oral hygiene guidance
- Diet and lifestyle recommendations
